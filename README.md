# Cancer-prediction

I built a cancer prediction model using python, pandas, scikit-learn and some SQL. My model had an accuracy of 94% on the test dataset before tuning and 96% after hyperparameter tuning. The machine learning model used were Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier.

I deployed my model using Python's Flask. The API code can be viewed in app.py

Thank you...
